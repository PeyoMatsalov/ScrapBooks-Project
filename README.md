# ScrapBook Project
## :mag_right: Project Introduction

This is a website where users can create books/noteboots, add pages to them and share them with other people. The ScrapBooks can be given specific names, descriptions and covers. They can be made public or private and be placed in different categories. It is also possible to add comments in the details pages of books. Visitors would have to register to access all but the home page of the website. In addition to the previous capabilities listed admin users have the ability to add, delete and edit categories and have access to the advanced site statistics.
